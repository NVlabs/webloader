WebLoader
=========

WebLoader has been retired in favor of WebDataset. WebDataset provides
the same functionality as WebLoader, but it takes advantage of PyTorch 1.2
IterableDataset and is much simpler to use and integrate with existing
PyTorch code.

You can find WebDataset at http://www.github.com/tmbdev/webdataset
